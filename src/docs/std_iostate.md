The type of the "state"s modified by I/O operations. 

The type `IO a` is isomorphic to `IOState -> (IOState, a)`.

Values of type `IOState` must be used linearly, i.e., each value must be used exactly once and must not be duplicated or discarded.

Values of type `IOState` are generated by the runtime when executing `IO` actions like `main` and passed linearly to various places in the program. At some places, `IOState` values are consumed by `FFI_CALL_IO` expressions and new `IOState` values are generated. When `IO` actions like `main` finish, they are consumed by the runtime and disappear.

Technically, `IOState` exists to specify the execution of I/O operations to the optimizer in the compiler.
